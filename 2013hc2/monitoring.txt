Monitoring
==========

- uptime: ideally, I'd like a check_boot_time that ensures the machine wasn't
  rebooted.
- cpu load: check_load nagios plugin
- memory load: check_mem from https://github.com/justintime/nagios-plugins

- rsync: execute command, grep total size

- firewall
  - check that rules are in place
  - warn if there are many log entries: tail /var/log/syslog | grep polyprog-firewall
- auth log

Also, need tools to easily install files on all hosts, or execute a command on
all hosts (to install a file, execute tar xf - and pipe in the file)
